            <p>Co-curricular activities make school life enjoyable. Like the saying goes, all work without play makes John a dull boy. How would we know that our students are talented if we only judged them against academics! An opportunity is therefor given for the to participate in various activities outside class. They are each encouraged to belong to at least one club or society.

                Parents too are encouraged to support their children and encourage their talent. Many times there is a temptation to think that these activities are a waste of time but some people have made it in life through talent. Mityana Standard SS shines brighter because of her prowess in the debate world. 

                It is important to note that more universities are requesting evidence of co-curricular involvement along with academic transcripts to satisfy the admissions criteria of these institutions.</p>
